A simple Space invader game

I’ve modeled this game from the classic cabinet arcade game “Space Invaders”. In this game, I add nothing new to this game; instead I, to the best of my ability, try to recreate a classic video game icon. However, in this attempt, I explore the fundamental basics of game programming, seasoned with the use of sprites animations, and dashed with an ample amount of thread use. In other words, something old & square into something round & new for the bemusement of all or perhaps just myself. 

Yay.
